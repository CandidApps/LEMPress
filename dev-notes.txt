    install mysql WITHOUT ncurses configuration

  Required

    make nginx run under deployer user
      sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

        user www-data;
        worker_processes  1;

        user deployer;
        worker_processes  1;

    If the script fails, it should be able to be re-run without bonking anything. Currently, It will fail on symlinking and mkdir. Probably other things.

    replace all instancess of 'cp' with 'rsync'
